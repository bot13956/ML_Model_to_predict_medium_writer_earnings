# ML_Model_to_predict_medium_writer_earnings
We build a simple model using the earnings_data.csv data set for predicting writer's daily earnings based on member reading time. This project is organized as follows: (1) importation of necessary libraries; (2) importation of dataset; (3) building of regression model; (4) visualization of fitted regression line; and (5) model training, testing, and evaluation.
